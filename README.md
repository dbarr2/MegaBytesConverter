# Megabyte Converter in Java

Welcome to the Megabyte Converter project. This simple yet functional Java application is designed to demonstrate the conversion of a quantity from kilobytes (KB) to megabytes (MB) and remaining kilobytes.

## Project Overview

The core functionality of this converter is to take an input value in kilobytes, perform the conversion to megabytes, and calculate any leftover kilobytes that don't make up a full megabyte. This project serves as an example of basic arithmetic operations, data type handling, and input/output in Java.

## Features

- **Input**: Accepts the number of kilobytes as input from the user or another function.
- **Conversion Logic**: Calculates how many whole megabytes are present in the input and determines the number of remaining kilobytes.
- **Output**: Displays the result in a readable format, specifying both the megabytes and the leftover kilobytes.

## How It Works

Given the value in kilobytes, the application uses the formula:

- 1 Megabyte (MB) = 1024 Kilobytes (KB)

The total kilobytes are divided by 1024 to find the full megabytes. The remainder of this division represents the remaining kilobytes.

## Usage

To use the Megabyte Converter, simply input the number of kilobytes you wish to convert. The program will then display the equivalent megabytes plus any additional kilobytes.
